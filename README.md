# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

This repository contains implementations of essential data structures and algorithmic examples in Java. It is structured for easy understanding and experimentation, making it useful for learners, interview preparation, and reinforcing core computer science concepts.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

The project is organized into subfolders under the `DataStructures/` directory, each representing a specific concept or structure:

- **ArrayList** â€“ Custom implementations and usage examples of dynamic arrays.
- **LinkedList** â€“ Implementation of singly/doubly linked lists and related operations.
- **Stack** â€“ LIFO stack operations and use cases.
- **HashMapExamples** â€“ Demonstrations of key-value pair handling using Java's HashMap.
- **BuffersExamples** â€“ Usage examples of buffer-related operations, likely including memory-efficient I/O patterns.

Each folder contains Java classes and examples demonstrating how the data structures work internally and how they are used in practical scenarios.

## ðŸ§° Technologies

- **Language:** Java
- **JDK:** Version 8 or above recommended
- **No external dependencies** (pure Java implementations)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To run any of the examples:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HademiData/Data-Structures-and-Algorithims-in-Java.git
